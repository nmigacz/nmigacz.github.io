                                    refresh and recenter the GPEM digital experience and develop a new centralized
                                    recruitment website. Nick’s contribution to these three goals, along with example

                            and active programs

                            students. Prior to Nick and the Digital Communications team being hired, the GPEM site housed
                            outdated information, multiple pages with different versions of the same process, and
                            program
                            information which disagreed with the content on school websites. What began as a mission
                            to
                            reign in misinformation would turn into the structure of the new recruitment website. Nick's

                                            The original GPEM site was mostly decentralized, relying heavily on linking
                                            to other
                                            school pages for program information. Siteimprove aided in conducting
                                            regular audits to
                                            maintain operational links, minimize 404s and increase our site
                                            reliability.

                            The GPEM website, communication flow and Slate build files had not been updated since 2012 during the last full refresh of the Loyola digital space. As the first Web Designer on the GPEM team, a crucial part of Nick’s role was to modernize styling and refactor code to meet current day standards. Brand styling updates would be done based on Loyola brand guidelines and weave in styling pulled from finalized mockups of the new centralized recruitment site.

                                            Introduced modern responsive design, increasing the usable page width that would benefit upcoming projects - as seen on the Employment Opportunities pages and Post Admit Portal above.

                                            The goal for the overall styling was for the user to feel like they are always on the new recruitment website, even if they were in a separate portal. This choice was made to ensure the user knew that all of these different elements are part of the same department at Loyola. Contrasting the previous site which had mis-matched templates and relied on school sites.

                                            In addition to design, focused on content displayed in the portal - this was an opportunity for Nick to realize he enjoyed strategizing how content would fit into a site to improve user experience.

                            The Digital Communications team became the lead on the new recruitment website project with their background in communications and web design and remained the driving force throughout its entirety. The old GPEM site lacked program search functionality, information on “Why Loyola” and alienated undecided prospective students, all of which the new recruitment site aimed to fix. Nick’s role included leading web design and working as the liaison between GPEM, Loyola’s University Marketing team and the vendor’s designers and developers. After switching hosting platforms and a rocky code handoff from our vendor, the Assistant Director of Digital Communications and Nick would go on to complete development of the site and launch the

                                        New site design didn’t need the frills of an undergrad website - grad and professional
                                        prospective students are interested in hard facts about programs and simple navigation

                                        The site would centralize all graduate and professional program pages, pulling them off
                                        of
                                        individual school sites.

                                            This furthered Digital Communciation’s goal of single sourcing and provided prospective students an easy way to view all available programs. Placing the programs under GPEM jurisdiction allowed for easy content maintenance and ensured equal levels of information were provided for each program.

                                            Faculty and school staff were encouraged to submit forms providing all necessary content during the content buildout. Post site completion, another form became accessible and could be filled out with content updates to their programs.

                                            The vendor’s deliverables consisted of information architecture, low/high-fidelity wireframes, site-wide copy and code framework.

                                            The GPEM team relied on Nick to consider website best practices, Loyola’s mission and branding guidelines when making final decisions on design presented by the vendor’s team.

                                            Nick presented the vendor’s mockups to internal stakeholders at Loyola, including the Assistant VP of Graduate and Professional Enrollment and Assistant VP of University Marketing and Communications, for feedback and final approval.

                                        The site was originally to be housed in the Terminal4 CMS; however, Digital Communications decided it was more important to maximize the potential of using single source data and moved to host the site in Slate.

                                        Building in Slate gave GPEM full governance of web development and styling that would
                                        have
                                        been limited in the CMS, which is managed by University Marketing.

                                            Using Slate also removed the need for a syncing process to pull information from

                                            into Terminal4. Rather than an overnight, daily sync, updated information from the
                                            dataset would be immediately available on the site.

                                            Nick and the Assistant Director of Digital Communications developed a dynamically populating search and filter functionality, the Program Finder, for the website within Slate - originally an add-on feature that was to be built by the CMS vendor - saving GPEM $65,000.

                                                This search and filter can work together or separately based on user needs, a feature the CMS version would’ve lacked.

                                                They built the program finder with limited resources from Slate documentation and Slate Community Knowledge Base as such a task had never been undertaken by anyone on the platform.

                                            The over 200+ program pages on the website are built dynamically using URL
                                            parameters in
                                            combination with liquid looping, content blocks and merge fields. This requires only
                                            one
                                            base page, similar to the Post Admit Portal, which can then call correlating
                                            information
                                            from the dataset based on the parameter, instantly building out a program page for
                                            the
                                            user - furthering our single source mission. The CMS would have required individual
                                            program pages with limited single sourcing.

                                        The vendor was aware of the hosting platform switch, yet provided a code framework built for the CMS, leaving Nick with extra work to update the code for Slate usage.

                                            Nick refactored the vendor's framework for all provided pages and broke down individual components needed to work for our Slate instance

                                            Vendor didn’t provide mockups of static pages (ex. <a href="https://gpem.luc.edu/portal/admission?tab=admission-process" target="_blank">Admission Process</a>, <a href="https://gpem.luc.edu/portal/admission?tab=returning-rambler" target="_blank">Returning Rambler</a>, etc)</strong>. Nick created mockups and developed these pages using the refactored framework and components.

                                        After months (years really…) of tedious backend work, delirious code scribbles on paper and repeated testing, Nick and his team released the new recruitment website in May 2023, hosted in Slate. The Digital Communications team were the first users on the platform to achieve such a feat!

                            Working on a small, brand new team required Nick to sometimes extend his responsibilities beyond Web Design.

                                        Before Nick received code from the external vendor, his team knew they would need an extra hand with adding content for 200+ program pages into our dataset. The Director of Digital Communications allocated funding for Nick to bring on a student worker through the end of the website project.

                                        The hiring process was handled by Nick: making the post on Handshake, sorting through applicants, creating a coding test, communicating with applicants, hosting interviews with the Digital Communications team and rejecting/accepting candidates. 
                                    </li>

                                            Provided Nick an opportunity to get a look into the workings of being a manager: meeting with them weekly, making sure they had a steady stream of work that balanced with time for them to focus on school as well. 
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            Gave the student worker an opportunity for an individual project to improve their coding skills and have something to add to their portfolio, in addition to working on the website.

                                            Used the student worker’s status as a current student to get real user insight on the new recruitment site and make updates and adjustments as needed.

                                        Hosting the new recruitment site in Slate was revolutionary - never achieved by any other university using this CRM. The Assistant Director of Digital Communications and Nick wanted to share the work they accomplished with other platform users so they could incorporate parts of it into their CRMs. They applied and were approved to speak at the 2023 Slate Summit.

                                        The presentation broke down the GPEM website into pieces that were more accessible to other Slate users. This way attendees could use/focus on parts that would be useful in their CRM instances. 
                                    </li>

                                        Nick and the Assistant Director of Digital Communications’ presentation had the largest turnout for a breakout group that year with an estimated 500 attendees spilling out the door. They received great feedback from the audience and many approached them afterwards sharing their excitement for the new possibilities they have unlocked within Slate.

                                        Nick was the first Web Designer and Developer on the GPEM team. With no precedent set, he understood the importance of documenting the work he completed. Nick wrote the documentation in a manner made accessible to the next Web Designer or to anyone else on his team. His goal was to make sure big hiccups could be avoided, and to make it easier for the next person to make edits and upgrades as they would see fit.
